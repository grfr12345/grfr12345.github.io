Inspired by the true story of a young man who was recruited by ASIO in the 1960s, Melissa Reeves combines raucous comedy, wit, and humour with Australian politics, in a story that is fast-paced and heartfelt. 

Underneath the banter, the scenes and outrageous dialogue, lies some very important themes â€“ communism, conservatism, relationships with others, relationships with oneself, and spying.
